# buglife-social
BugLife is a full-stack social media platform built with the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js), designed for people to share life’s glitches — whether it’s actual code bugs, daily life struggles, memes, rants, or just casual moments. Think of it as the chill zone for developers, students, and meme-lovers alike.
